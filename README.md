# Pair Programming test for Javascript

Treat this code as a merge request from a developer, and provide feedback.

The purpose of the function: `The code sorts a JSON stuct by the key, which is a number`

The method is in `./index.js` and tests in `./index.test.js`

Example input:
```json
{
 "1": "first",
 "2": "second",
 "3": "third",
 "11": "eleventh",
 "07": "seventh",
 "20": "twentyth",
 "02": "secondsecond" 
}
```
Expected output
```json
{
 "1": "first",
 "2": "second",
 "02": "secondsecond" ,
 "3": "third",
 "07": "seventh",
 "11": "eleventh",
 "20": "twentyth"
}
```

## Approach

You will have 15-20 minutes to provide feedback on the merge request.

Within this timelimit, you can use any approach that seems appropriate. Don't worry if you can't address everything!

The interviewers will act as the developer of this code, and they are fully available as they would be in a normal office setting.
